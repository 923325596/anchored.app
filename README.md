**_A blockchain enabled verification platform_**

Proofd utilizes [Chainpoint's](https://chainpoint.org/) innovative technology which allows users to securely link a hash of their data, such as important documents, to the [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) blockchain. After logging in, users can connect with third party applications such as [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/) and get timestamp proofs for any file. By associating data to a tamper-proof, immutable ledger, it can be mathematically proven that the data existed at an exact time and place.

### Stack

Proofd utilizes [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment, and is built in full stack JavaScript with a [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) frontend, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)/[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) backend, and a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) database in production, while a [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database was used in development.

### Frontend

[https://chainpoint-docusign.netlify.com/](https://chainpoint-docusign.netlify.com/)

The frontend of Proofd utilizes React, Redux for state management, React-Router, and axios for making our API calls, as well as Auth0 for authentication, with both local, and social login availability.

### Backend

[https://chainpoint-docusign-server.herokuapp.com/](https://chainpoint-docusign-server.herokuapp.com/)

Our backend consists of Node.js, Express.js, and utilizes the Chainpoint API for connecting to the blockchain, as well as Stripe for payment processing.
